# Heimdall-styles
Make your Heimdall looks better.

## Why ?
Heimdall is a web application that helps you to manage your projects. It is a simple and easy to use but isn't beautiful to my eyes. I want to make it looks better. I only share what I made with you. Don't expect anything more (though if you pose an issue, I will try to fix it).

## How to use ?
Please go to your Heimdall website and click on the "Settings" button (or go to `http://HEIMDALLSERVER/settings`).

At the bottom of the page, you will find two rows. The first one is "Custom CSS" and the second one is "Custom JavaScript".

You can add your custom CSS and JavaScript code here by clicking on the "Edit" button (pencil icon) on the corresponding row.

This will open a new tab where you can write your code.

## Styles
Here is the list of all the styles I made for Heimdall:
* **moving forms background**: There are multiples forms that are moving. This style is applied to the background of the form.
* **switch**: This one is a complete theme to make Heimdall looks like a Nintendo Switch. (+**moving forms background**).
